# Netflix UI Redesign

Don't get wrong - Netflix has a wonderful UI. I just wanted to see if I could mess around in Flutter and replicate some of the things I love about the interface as well as tweak some things that caught my eye.

## Inspiration
I saw a few shots on Dribbble ([here](https://dribbble.com/shots/5026483-Netflix-Mobile-App-Redesign/attachments) and [here](https://dribbble.com/shots/4987245-Netflix-Redesign)) that inspired this project. 

## Some Live Shots

I tried to make this responsive as possible. Here are a few 'action shots'. 
Please note: I couldn't get a well-known show or movie for use in the video player for copyright reasons, so I used [this](http://publicdomainmovie.net/movie/sintel) open movie from Blender.
